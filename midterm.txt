Structure of a Compiler
Scanning
	Language and Regex (scanner parser AST
	NFA
	Translating RE to NFA
	DFA from NFA (subset)
Parsing
	Resolving ambiguity
Rightmost / Reverse Rightmost
	  LR(0)
	  SLR Parsing Table
	  Shift Reduce

HANDLE is always on the right most side of production rule
TERMINALS IN BOLD

KNOW HOW TO DO SHIFT REDUCE PARSING WITH SLR TABLE
$ = end of input
Grammar:
	Context free
	Terminals on right - non-terminal on left

A language is ambiguous if it has more than one right most derivation.
DFA -> NFA upper bound is 2^N

KNOW HOW STACK LAID OUT
KNOW HOW ACTIVATION RECORDS ARE LAID OUT
	  KNOW THE NESTED FUNCTION WITH STATIC LINKS EXAMPLE

STATIC VERSUS DYNAMIC SCOPE
